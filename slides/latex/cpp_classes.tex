	The methods can be defined outside of the declaration.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item declare class in \ctext{classname.h}

\misc{
	Some methods are special, including
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the \textbf{default constructor} which is called for instances without specific initialization
		\item the \textbf{copy constructor} which is used for passing argument by value and when assigning a copy of a variable to a new variable
		\item the \textbf{destructor} which is called when the instance is deleted

	Members of classes can be 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \ctext{public}: can be accessed from everywhere, 
		\item \ctext{protected}: can only be accessed by classes that extend it, or 
		\item \ctext{private}: can only be accessed by methods of that instance
	\end{itemize}
	
	By default, \ctext{struct}'s have every member \ctext{public} whereas \ctext{class}'es default to \ctext{private}.

\misc{
	Normal variable and methods are relative to the instance of the class that stores them.
	
	The keyword \ctext{static} can be used to declare variables or methods that are relative to the namespace of the class, shared by all instances.
	
	Accessing and using static members is done using the namespace operator \ctext{::}.
